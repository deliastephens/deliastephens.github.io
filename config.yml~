      Hi! I'm Delia. I recently graduated with a combined SB/SM from MIT AeroAstro, where my research focused on [developing flexible policies for decision-making under uncertainty](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/144709/Stephens-delias-SM-AeroAstro-2022-thesis.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y). Right now, I'm learning how computers work as a Cyber Operations Officer in the United States Air Force.

      I like to keep myself busy by riding (and fixing) bicycles, shooting photos, and making useless things. In the past, I've built a rocket that carries a GoPro, biked across the country, and taken a lot of notes.
