In addition to taking startlingly mediocre photos, I'm also trying to fulfill my desire for delayed gratification by working on my photo development techniques. Thus far, I've used the [Cinestill DF96 Monobath](https://cinestillfilm.com/products/df96-developer-fix-b-w-monobath-single-step-solution-for-processing-at-home), which combines developer and fixer in an easy-to-use, grainy solution. 

I shoot primarily on Kodak negatives, and have only developed ISO100 so far (my first ISO400 roll experienced a user-caused loading error, and I ended up with an entirely blank roll).

The film development process is startlingly simple and only requires a few materials; at the end of the day, it's probably better than sending negatives to a shop and waiting/paying for development. Here's my current equipment list:

1. [Paterson Development Tank]() for developing the rolls.
2. [Funnel]() for moving liquid around.
3. [Amber Growler]() for storage.
4. []()
