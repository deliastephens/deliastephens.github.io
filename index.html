<p>
Hi! I'm Delia, a <del>freshman</del> <del>sophomore</del> <del>junior</del> senior at MIT pursuing a degree in aeronautical engineering.
</p>
<p>
Right now, I spend most of my time <a href="/visual/">taking pictures</a>,
making <a href="https://github.com/deliastephens/interrobang">useless things</a>,
and <a href="https://mitspokes.wixsite.com/2018">riding my bicycle</a>.
I also occasionally <a href="https://medium.com/@deliaornodelia">ramble nonsenically</a> and fly drones.
In the fall, I play field hockey for MIT's varsity team and enjoy the nice weather.
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in stuff that goes fast--rockets, drones, planes, and bikes.
I love breaking stuff in my garage at home or on the side of the road halfway across the country.
Currently, I'm working on <a href="/visual/film/">shooting and developing film</a>.
In the past, I've built a <a href="/aero/cameroc/">rocket that carries a GoPro</a>, done some drone photography,
<a href="/misc/Spokes/">biked across the country</a>, and worked on various other personal projects.
</p>
